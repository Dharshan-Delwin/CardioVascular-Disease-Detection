CardioVascular Disease Detection deals with the cardio vascular.csv dataset and it has achieved highest of 99% accuracy in Hist Gradient Boosting Classifier, 99% accuracy in ExtraTree Classifier and 97% accuracy in Decision Tree Classifier. In this project many algorithms are used such as Support vector classifier, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Classifier and GradientBoosting and HistGradient Boosting Classifier. This algorithms are very useful to detect or identify the Heart Disease or Cardio Vascular related diseases.
